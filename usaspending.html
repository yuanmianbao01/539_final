          <h2 class="subtitle">Challenge</h2>
          <h2>Who are the users?</h2>
          <p>
            As the official source of government spending data,
            <a href="http://usaspending.gov/">USAspending</a> is supposed to
            promote federal spending transparency by reaching as various types
            of US citizens as possible. However, the current use cases are
            mostly limited to specific groups of specialists, such as government
            employees and academic researchers.
          </p>
          <p>
            To better promote federal spending transparency, I conducted a
            foundational research to understand who are the missed user groups
            and their needs. The research insights helped the design team to
            identify key design concepts for different user groups and to
            establish a prioritized roadmap.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="subtitle">Protocol</h2>
          <h2>In-depth Interview</h2>
          <p>
            The research is designed to identify user groups and understand why
            USAspending.gov may not be effectively serving several groups. I
            planned a series of interviews using a semi-structured approach,
            which included in-depth interviews and usability testing sessions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I first asked a set of questions to understand motivations and
            reasons why users find federal spending data relevant and of
            interest. Then I directed the participants to use USAspending.gov to
            look for the information of interest to assess how USAspending.gov
            performed in meeting users' needs and expectations.
          </p>

          <h2 class="subtitle">Analysis</h2>
          <h2>Generating Personas</h2>
          <p>
            In the analysis process, I paid specific attention to the goals to
            contextualize participants’ pain points and attitudes toward the
            website. Based on the similarity of goals across participants, I
            formalized four personas.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The <b>Learner</b> wants to satisfy personal curiosity about
              federal spending.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <b>Researcher</b> wants to produce written reports using
              information on USAspending.gov.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <b>Opportunity Seeker</b> wants to help themselves or others
              obtain federal award opportunities.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <b>Agency Fact Checker</b> wants to comply with government
              reporting mandates.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="subtitle">Insights</h2>
          <h2>The Interdisciplinary Nature of Users</h2>
          <p>
            The goal of a user on USAspneding.gov varies as the context varies,
            instead of being set in stone. For example, professors use the
            website as academic researchers for their own research projects,
            while they become learners when they facilitate students to learn
            about federal spending data in introductory classes.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the interdisciplinary nature of users in mind, I helped the
            design team to shift their mindset from designing for occupations to
            designing for goals, which would promote the flexibility and
            inclusiveness of the website design.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Relatable-ness: Does the information matter to users?</h2>
          <p>
            We find that the group with the least use frequency are the
            learners. Why? That’s because they are unable to find the
            information that matters to them. Learners are not the president:
            they care more about spendings relatable to them instead of data of
            the whole federal government across different departments. What the
            learners look for are usually spending data that geographically
            related to their daily life or to their personal connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we identified the learners as the biggest missed opportunity for
            the website, I assisted the design team to prioritize re-designing
            for learners to help them find their relatable information more
            efficiently and with less barriers.
