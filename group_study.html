          <h2 class="subtitle">Challenge</h2>
          <h2>Why aren’t students using the Group Study Mode?</h2>
          <p>
            On Problem Roulette, students can practice exam questions either
            individually or in a group. However, the usage rate of the Group
            Study Mode is significantly lower than that of the Individual Mode.
            To improve the feature’s usage rate, the team aims to understand the
            reasons behind the low usage of the Group Study Mode and identify
            what is missing.
          </p>
          <p>After communicating with the stakeholders, I identified the following research questions: 
            <ul>
              <li>What are some common Group Study Mode use settings? How do group members study together? </li>
              <li>What is the role of Group Study Mode in these settings? </li>
              <li>What are the unmet needs? What are the future opportunities? </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="subtitle">Method</h2>
          <h2>In-depth Interview & Ethnographic Observation</h2>
          <p>Although the Group Study Mode was launched years ago, the team is still unclear about students’ needs for studying in groups. Therefore, I proposed an exploratory approach to answer the team’s questions. Inspired by the <b>Jobs to be Done framework</b>, I interviewed 6 students who had relatively higher feature engagement.  </p>
          <p>While interviews can capture users’ attitudes and mental models, the actual interactions among students in a group are missing. To further capture study group dynamics and interactions, I conducted participant observation in a peer-led study group. </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="subtitle">Analysis</h2>
          <h2>Analyzing the Challenges and Current Solutions </h2>
          <p>Through an inductive, thematic analysis, I identified the key stages of studying as a group. For each stage I discovered: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>the students’ goals (JTBD) for each stage </li>
            <li>current solutions </li>
            <li>Gaps in needs</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By comparing their goals with the current available solutions, I identified students’ unmet needs and therefore future opportunities for Problem Roulette.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h2 class="subtitle">Insights</h2>
          <h2>Students found the feature helpful when studying in groups… </h2>
          <p>To the team’s surprise, participants valued the Group Study Mode feature. They loved that the feature facilitated the group study dynamics by </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensuring time for individual work on each question</li>
            <li>Facilitating discussion about the solution</li>
            <li>Encouraging the same study pace among the group </li>
          </ul>
          <p>This insight reaffirms the value of the feature for the team and their mind to develop more on the feature. </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>…but there are future opportunities for user acquisition and retention </h2>
          <p>To boost usage rates, it's essential to enhance the experience for existing users while also attracting new ones. My findings helped the team focus on both user acquisition and retention simultaneously. </p>
        </div>

          <h2 class="subtitle">Findings about User Acquisition</h2>
          <div>
            <h3>Students need help with group formation within their classes</h3>
            <p>Only those who took classes with friends used the feature</p>
            <p>Participants took the same class with their friends, so they could group together for studying. But what if a student doesn’t know anyone on the class? </p>
            <p>Opportunity: Facilitate group formation with classmates to increase the usage of Group Study Mode </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Study facilitators of the existing peer-led study programs need resources to streamline group study facilitation </h3>
            <p>From my ethnographic observation, I found that the existing study programs shared similar procedure as the group study feature, and the program facilitators can streamline the group facilitation by using the feature. </p>
            <p>- Opportunity: Collaborate with the existing study programs and promote the Group Study Mode feature</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="subtitle">Findings about User Retention</h2>
          <h3>Students wanted to work on as many new questions as possible</h3>
          <p>This was because they wanted to discover the unfamiliar areas to review before an exam</p>
          <p>However, every time the students took a break after studying for a while, they had to restart a session and go through the questions they’ve solved again before working on new questions.  </p>
          <p>Opportunity: Adding a “Resume” feature; Optimizing the algorithm for “the next question” to align with students’ mental model. </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="subtitle">Stakeholder Communication</h2>
          <h2>Facilitating Stakeholder Decision Making </h2>
          <p>When sharing insights, I adopted an workshop-like approach to both present findings and facilitate decision making among stakeholders. I strategically divided findings into several digestible parts. After presenting one part, I facilitated discussion and brainstorming among stakeholders around that part of findings, which assisted stakeholders to not only understand the findings and but also have a clear sense of corresponding next steps. In this way, I helped my stakeholders bridge the gaps between insights and actionable next steps. </p>
